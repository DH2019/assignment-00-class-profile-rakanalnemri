# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

The cards could serve as a useful interactive tool for historians and humanists to collaborate on research topics that may suffer from sparse or challenging research material. Through this, a website composed of cards could help strengthen a database for an understudied event or concept. An example would be the relatively overlooked topic of post-colonial masculinity in Middle Eastern societies and its changes (a topic I personally tried to write a paper about but couldn't due to the difficulty of finding sources). For this, a historian could create a website showcasing different sources to depict how Arab masculinity has been historically altered, and other historians with knowledge of the material could contribute by providing reference data on the topic. Through this, research that might be initially difficult to find in libraries or on search engines would now be flourished with added sources.

## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product?

It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure that data shared by participants remains secure, and that personal information - unintended to be accessible publicly - remains excluded from the finalized results. Moreover, it is also the researcher's responsibility to certify that the data sent by students is accurately portrayed on the website and not altered or skewed in any manner (intentional or not). Since the goal of the assignment entitles that basic information about the students will be publicly available, participants should always have the right to alter or revise any of their personal information on the website, even in its finalized form. 

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

As mentioned, each card would encompass a separate citation on an understudied topic. The cards themselves would contain a brief description of the source and provide a reference for researchers to use. One main issue of concern from this would be that the brief descriptions provided to explain a source would not be able to accurately encompass the message or intent of a listed citation. This could prove detrimental to the further use of a reference, as the simplification of a complex document to merely a few descriptive sentences may hinder its future use or cause confusion over the intent of a provided source.
